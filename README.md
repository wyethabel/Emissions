# Streamlit Dashboard
This project was focused on embedding a Folium choropleth map into a Streamlit web-dashboard. 

It features a sidebar with multiple selectors, an interactive map with popups, and 2 scalable linegraphs showing change over time.
Since it is importing a large chunk of data into a Folium map it may take a moment to load.
